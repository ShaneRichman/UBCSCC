          <p>
            The UBC Sports Car Club strives to run safe, fun, and competatively priced trackdays for our members. Our trackdays are open to virtually all types of vehicles from stock to modified. “R-compound” tires are acceptable for Senior drivers (Groups A and B) provided the weather cooperates (more information under Vehicle/Tech Requirements).
            <br/>
            Each event will be comprised of 3 run groups; A, B, and C.<br/>
            Group A – Experienced drivers/ track ready vehicles<br/>
            Group B – Average paced drivers/ vehicles<br/>
            Group C – New drivers
          </p>
          <p>

            Each run group will have almost 2 hours on track, broken up into 4 sessions, starting at 9:30am and ending at 4:00pm. We will also have a one hour lunch break where we will have complementary food, water, and pop available to all those participating.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <h3>Novice Information:</h3>
          <p>
            For the purposes of our track days, we define a novice as a person who has not completed a track day, in the car they are planning on driving, with either the UBCSCC or another group that we recognize and can verify. <strong>Important: if we cannot verify your previous experience, we will classify you as a novice for the entirety of your first track day with UBCSCC.</strong> We will be accepting a maximum of twelve (12) novice drivers for each of our trackdays.
          </p>
          <p>
            Novices will not be allowed to carry any passengers except a qualified senior driver for the purpose of instruction. Also, novices will be expected to drive on street tires only regardless of weather.
          </p>
          <h3>Vehicle/Tech Requirements:</h3>
          <p>
            Ensuring your car is safe for the track is <strong>your responsibility</strong> – not ours.

We will not be torquing lug nuts on-site, however, if we have any questions about the mechanical soundness of your car, we hold the privilege to not to allow you to run – please be proactive and make sure everything in your car is up to the task.
