              UBCSCC occasionally holds TSD Rallies from time to time, a tradition stemming back to the 1950â€™s. Our members often represent UBCSCC when they participate in TSD Rallies held by local clubs, such as <Link to="http://www.rallybc.com/wcra/wcra.html">West Coast Rally Association (WCRA)</Link> (WCRA membership required).

            <h2>TSD = Time Speed Distance</h2>
            <p>
              A Time Speed Distance Rally can be summarized by the following:
            </p>
            <p>
              -Competitors consist of teams of two; One driver and one navigator<br/>
              -A routebook is given to each team with a prescribed route at designated speeds to follow<br/>
              -Checkpoints (hidden and unknown to competitors) are placed along the route<br/>
              -Objective is to cross each Checkpoint at exactly the right time by using the designated speeds and distance travelled<br/>
              -Scoring is based on arriving early or late at each Checkpoint (1 point = 1 second). Accumulation of the least points wins<br/>
              -Stages are held on public roads as well as private roads. Designated speeds do not exceed local speed limits
